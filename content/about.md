## Hi, I'm Moh Eric

I'm a software engineer based in Jakarta, Indonesia. I love building scalable systems and exploring new technologies—especially when it comes to backend development, data engineering, and cloud infrastructure.

## What I Do

I work across the full stack, but here's what really gets me excited:

- **Backend Development**: Crafting APIs and microservices with .NET/C#, Go, Python, and Java Spring Boot
- **Frontend Development**: Building modern web apps using Vue.js and TypeScript
- **Mobile Development**: Creating cross-platform apps with Flutter/Dart and native Android apps with Kotlin
- **Data Engineering**: Working with CDC (Change Data Capture), Kafka, and real-time data pipelines
- **Cloud & DevOps**: Docker, Terraform, and infrastructure automation

## Tech Stack

Here's what I work with on a regular basis:

**Languages**: C#, Go, Python, Dart, TypeScript, Kotlin, Java, R

**Backend**: .NET Core, Gin, FastAPI, Spring Boot

**Frontend**: Vue.js, TypeScript, React

**Mobile**: Flutter, Kotlin (Android)

**Data & Streaming**: Kafka, Debezium, PostgreSQL, MySQL

**Tools**: Docker, Terraform, Git, Hugo

## Open Source

I'm a big believer in learning by doing and sharing what I know. Check out my projects and experiments on [GitHub](https://github.com/rickseven), where you'll find:

- CDC pipelines with Debezium and Kafka
- REST API samples in various languages
- Android development patterns
- Data analysis and visualization projects

## About This Blog

This is where I document my learning journey and share practical tutorials on software development. I write about real-world implementations, best practices, and solutions to problems I've actually faced.

If you find something helpful here, feel free to share it or drop me a message!
