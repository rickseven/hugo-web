## Hi, I'm Moh Eric

I'm a software engineer based in Jakarta, Indonesia, with a passion for building scalable systems and exploring new technologies. I focus on backend development, data engineering, and cloud infrastructure.

## What I Do

I work across the full stack, but I'm particularly interested in:

- **Backend Development**: Building APIs and microservices with .NET/C#, Go, Python, and Java Spring Boot
- **Frontend Development**: Creating modern web apps with Vue.js and TypeScript
- **Mobile Development**: Cross-platform apps with Flutter/Dart and native Android with Kotlin
- **Data Engineering**: Working with CDC (Change Data Capture), Kafka, and real-time data pipelines
- **Cloud & DevOps**: Docker, Terraform, and infrastructure automation

## Tech Stack

Here are some technologies I work with regularly:

**Languages**: C#, Go, Python, Dart, TypeScript, Kotlin, Java, R

**Backend**: .NET Core, Gin, FastAPI, Spring Boot

**Frontend**: Vue.js, TypeScript, React

**Mobile**: Flutter, Kotlin (Android)

**Data & Streaming**: Kafka, Debezium, PostgreSQL, MySQL

**Tools**: Docker, Terraform, Git, Hugo

## Open Source

I believe in learning by doing and sharing knowledge. You can find my projects and experiments on [GitHub](https://github.com/rickseven), including:

- CDC pipelines with Debezium and Kafka
- REST API samples in various languages
- Android development patterns
- Data analysis and visualization projects

## This Blog

This website is where I document what I learn and share tutorials on software development. I write about practical implementations, best practices, and solutions to problems I've encountered.

If you find something useful here, feel free to share it or reach out.

## Get in Touch

I'm always open to discussing technology, collaborating on projects, or just having a conversation about software engineering.
